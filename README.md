# MoleculeViewer
##A package for visualizing molecules.

MoleculeViewer is a Mathematica package that renders molecules in a manner resembling physical molecular models. In particular, multiple bonds are depicted as out-of-plane bonds.

The package supports features like multiple atom legends, custom coloring of atoms, atom highlighting and tooltips.

The package also provides a number of auxiliary functions that use the services of [Open Babel](http://openbabel.org/), [JME](http://www.molinspiration.com/jme/), and [ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/).

Download the paclet from the [releases](https://github.com/tpfto/MoleculeViewer/releases) page, and see the file `molviewer.nb` for more detailed information. A molecule gallery `gallery.nb` is also provided.
